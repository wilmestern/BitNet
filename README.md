Try it out via this [demo](https://demo-bitnet-h0h8hcfqeqhrf5gf.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/), or build and run it on your own [CPU](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source) or [GPU](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/blob/main/gpu/README.md).

bitnet.cpp is the official inference framework for 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). It offers a suite of optimized kernels, that support **fast** and **lossless** inference of 1.58-bit models on CPU and GPU (NPU support will coming next).

The first release of bitnet.cpp is to support inference on CPUs. bitnet.cpp achieves speedups of **1.37x** to **5.07x** on ARM CPUs, with larger models experiencing greater performance gains. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption by **55.4%** to **70.0%**, further boosting overall efficiency. On x86 CPUs, speedups range from **2.37x** to **6.17x** with energy reductions between **71.9%** to **82.2%**. Furthermore, bitnet.cpp can run a 100B BitNet b1.58 model on a single CPU, achieving speeds comparable to human reading (5-7 tokens per second), significantly enhancing the potential for running LLMs on local devices. Please refer to the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16144) for more details.

**Latest optimization** introduces parallel kernel implementations with configurable tiling and embedding quantization support, achieving **1.15x to 2.1x** additional speedup over the original implementation across different hardware platforms and workloads. For detailed technical information, see the [optimization guide](src/README.md).

## Personal Notes

> **Fork notes (for my own reference):** I'm using this primarily to experiment with the 2B model on my Linux x86 machine. The build steps under "Build from Source" worked out of the box for me on Ubuntu 24.04 with GCC 13. One thing I found helpful: passing `-j$(nproc)` to `make` cuts the build time significantly on multi-core machines.
>
> **Quick run command I use locally:**
> ```bash
> python run_inference.py -m models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf \
>   -p "What is the capital of France?" -n 128 -t $(nproc)
> ```
> The `-t $(nproc)` flag to use all available threads made a noticeable difference in tokens/sec on my 16-core machine.
>
> **Tested context lengths:** I've found `-c 2048` to be a sweet spot for my 32GB RAM machine — going higher (4096+) noticeably increases memory usage without much practical benefit for my use cases. If you have 64GB+ RAM, `-c 4096` should be fine.
